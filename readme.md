An OCaml implementation of LambdaLF, a simple dependent type lambda calculus with **dependent product types**.

LambdaLF is formalised in the chapter 2 of *Advanced Topics of Types and Programming Languages (ATTAPL)*.

The code is based on the implementation of simply typed lambda calculus from TAPL.

Some extensions added:

* Support for general recursion.
* Booleans and Natural Numbers together with some operations.
* A primitive Vector type dependent on Natural Numbers.

Some examples can be found in `examples_xxx.ml` files.
